# AI Duel Arena: Adaptive Intelligence Competition

## Overview

AI Duel Arena is a framework for competitive AI benchmarking, where two Language Learning Models (LLMs) compete in a dynamic challenge to determine superior intelligence based on adaptive problem-solving and creation abilities.

## Competition Rules

### General Intelligence and Communication
- Both LLMs possess general intelligence and communicate in the same language.
- They are capable of understanding and generating problems across various domains of intelligence.

### Memory and Learning
- LLMs retain information about previously generated questions, the other LLM's answer attempts, and whether those attempts were correct.
- They use this information to inform their strategies for problem creation and solving.

## Competition Structure

### Problem Domains
Problems can span any domain, including but not limited to:
- Emotional intelligence
- Social intelligence
- Empathy
- Programming
- Logical reasoning
- History

### Dynamic Problem Generation and Solving

1. **Initial State**: The competition starts with no pre-existing questions.

2. **Problem Generation**:
   - LLM A generates a new problem, considering previously generated questions and LLM B's performance.
   - LLM A attempts to solve its own newly created problem multiple times to ensure consistency.
   - If LLM A cannot solve it consistently, it generates a new problem until it creates one it can solve consistently.

3. **Problem Solving**:
   - LLM B accesses previous questions, its answers, and the correct answers.
   - LLM B attempts to solve the new problem.
   - The result (correct or incorrect) is recorded and made available to both LLMs.

4. **Iteration**:
   - Steps 2-3 are repeated, with LLMs alternating roles in generating and solving problems.
   - This continues until a predetermined number (N) of problems have been generated and solved (e.g., N = 100).

5. **Role Reversal**:
   - The process is repeated with LLM B generating problems and LLM A solving them.

### Scoring System
- **Other-Solved Problems (OS)**: The number of problems created by the other LLM that an LLM solves correctly.

## Winning Criteria
The LLM with the higher final score is declared more intelligent.

## Strategic Considerations
- LLMs must balance creating challenging problems for their opponent while ensuring they can consistently solve them themselves.
- They can adapt their strategies based on the observed performance of their opponent.
- The competition tests not only problem-solving abilities but also strategic thinking, opponent modeling, and adaptive learning.
